# FRAMY

## Install

```bash
cargo install framy
```

## Usage

Currently the only thing that `FRAMY` can do, is creating a new pallet. The pallet compiles and is setup with the default dependencies. You can resolve the remaining `TODO`s and use it.

```bash
framy
```

You can see the output in the [`examples/framy_example`](./examples/framy_example) folder.
