# FRAMY

Currently the only thing that `FRAMY` can do, is creating a new pallet. The pallet compiles and is setup with the default dependencies plus benchmarking and tests. You are good to go and just have to resolve the remaining `TODO`s.

Note that it will not add the pallet to your workspace; this needs to be done manually.

## Install

```bash
cargo install framy -f --locked
```

## Usage

```bash
framy
```

You can see the output in the [`examples/pallet-example`](./examples/pallet-example) folder.
